## Stretch/Extras

- As a stretch exercise, the "Write a new tweet" icon at the top right hand corner of the nav bar was turned into a functioning button. This button displays the "What are you humming about" text input area with a slide down animation. The text area is hidden from the user until the "Write a new tweet" button is pressed.
